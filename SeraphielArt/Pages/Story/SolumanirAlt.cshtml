$@"Edgar grows closer to Olivia and Carmilla, spending many months with them inside of the demon territories. Starting to help Olivia recharge her energy, Carmilla keeps trying to get Edgar to drink her blood, worried he may succumb to old age eventually.
<br>Olivia starts to often tease Carmilla, going as far as teasing Carmilla for her hesitation fo confronting her mother directly. Olivia starts to hit sensibly Carmilla, which pushes Carmilla into rage and makes her lose control temporarily, Carmilla starts choking Olivia and bites deep into her neck, spilling lots of blood and vampirizing her. Edgar forces them apart after Olivia's painful screams.
<br>Desperate to heal Olivia and blaming only herself for losing control, Carmilla tries to stop Olivia's brain from degenerating due to the demon transformation, but she's only able to stop it from going too fast. Carmilla believes Edgar hates her, but he finally licks Carmilla's blood to show her he does not.
<br>It's clear Olivia's situation is getting worse, as within a few days Olivia started developing vampire fangs, her eyes started turning red and her intelligence started decreasing. Carmilla decides it may be better to request Audrey's help, she asks Edgar to come with her as she heads north to Audrey's castle. 
<br>Edgar flies to Audrey's castle with Carmilla, and once arrived they end up fighting hordes of vampires defending the castle, the two of them break in and find Audrey in the banquet hall. Though, Audrey immediately refuses to help Carmilla, as Carmilla's growing power is menacing Audrey's own power over the vampires.
<br>Being rejected Carmilla begs her, only to be refused again, Audrey launches a surprise attack on Carmilla with the intent to kill her, but is stopped by Edgar as he saw it coming. A battle start between them, in which it's clear that Audrey has the upper hand. The weavermaid ambushes Audrey while Edgar and Carmilla are fighting, but the tactic fails.
<br>Audrey is overwhelming them, Edgar is forced into a defensive stance as Audrey starts to repeatedly attack him with her many blood whips, striking him from every angle and starting to accumulate damage on him. Carmilla seized the opportunity to dash toward Audrey, she uses the rapier Edgar trained her with and rolls the whip attacks away from her, dodging them until she's close enough to Audrey to stab her chest. Carmilla hugs Audrey as both fall to the ground together.
<br>As they're falling, Carmilla bites into Audrey's neck, taking her blood and ascending to a vampire lord herself. The battle continues, now Audrey cannot use her network to regenerate either as Carmilla is a lord in her same network. Edgar feels something shift inside him after Carmilla's lord ascent. Carmilla's blood in Edgar reactivates and enchanches his dark abilities, glowing a dark red color as he grows exponentially. Edgar absorbs the life out of two vampires and recovers in time to continue the battle.
<br>Carmilla is still weaker than Audrey even as a lord, the rapier Edgar had gifted her was broken by Audrey, forcing Carmilla to finally use blood weapons as she always could. Carmilla and Edgar are able to suppress Audrey by working together. Carmilla bites into Audrey again, draining her of all her blood and ending the life of the vampire lord. Carmilla transforms gruesomely into her final stage as vampire lord. Carmilla manipulates the network to give Olivia her conciousness back, yet Olivia will stay a half-vampire.

$@"Alice and Kael return to the mansion together. Leila returns to her apartment and starts to feel the threat that Edgar could be if he continued down the demon path. Leila starts to study ways she could use her magic to defeat demons more effectively.
<br>Kael starts hiring new nurses as maids to take care of Alice's pregnancy. Leila approaches Alice one day and tells her that she needs to acquire a gem herself as her alchemy doesn't seem powerful enough in combat. Alice agrees to sneak inside of the sanctuary to complete the trials.
<br>One night Alice sneaks inside the sanctuary and starts to undergo the trials, Dawn Star noticed Alice and becomes curious about her after looking at her undergo the trials. In the first trial Alice experienced the bliss of a perfect world that wanted her to never leave it, in the second trial Alice experienced the loss of everything she loved, in the third trial Alice experienced love from Leila as an alternative life the two could have shared if Alice didn't hesitate back there.

Dawn Star, who caused Alice to collapse, approached her to copy all of her memories and apply some changes on Alice's child with her own corrupted genes. Alice wakes up alone minutes later with the mana gem around her neck and leaves.
<br>While Edgar and Carmilla continue expanding, the news reports in Huvia show massive vampires armies being assembled on the north and images of vampire incursion on villages up north where every person got vampirized as a result.

$@"Carmilla and Edgar head to the south, looking for the werewolf lord. Carmilla intents on fighting each lord on her own as to not endanger the lives of her subjects. Edgar drops Carmilla in the middle of the werewolves army and she starts dancing, vampirizing every one of them in gruesome ways using her blood constructs.
<br>Carmilla ends up facing the werewolf lord. Seraphiel intervenes giving the lord additional strength, making her halo appear behind him as he is blessed by her power. Carmilla's speed and strength get immediately outclassed by the lord, which starts to beat her down violently. Carmilla is unable to fight back, but her regeneration grants her pseudo-immortality. The werewolf lord starts to tire himself out giving Carmilla the opportunity to immobilize it in one single strike. Carmilla doesn't kill him, but vampirizes him so he may be healed afterwards.
<br>Carmilla and Edgar head north to confront the last demon lord standing. Edgar flies Carmilla to the Monolith, where the Lich lord is waiting for them. Like with the werewolf, the Lich is empowered by Seraphiel and a halo appears behind him. Carmilla had decided to fight him on her own, but as she sees the lich absorbing her energy and almost nullify her healing, she calls in for Edgar to help her.
<br>Edgar tried to absorb the energy from the Lich, but is unable to fully drain him as the energy within him is immense. Edgar can feel it's a combination of many different energies, and as he's absorbing them he has to release them as the same time, radiating his body with heat and starting to glow. With the Lich's energy being drained enough, Carmilla is able to deal a fatal blow and destroy it.
<br>With the grand majority of the demons converted into vampires in this continent, Carmilla rises to the top of the Monolith and extracts the Alexantrite from within, making the giant cross shaped structure collapse. Carmilla 's soul is linked with the gemstone by Seraphiel as she started to use it.
<br>The Alexandrite's power spreads through Carmilla's network, destroying every trace of the demon toxins and undoing the transformation on every one. Making Olivia, Clay, the Weaver, the Dryad and every other demon turn back into their mortal selves before the disaster.
<br>Carmilla attempts to destroy the Alexandrite, but with her power fading she's unable to do. Edgar strikes the Alexandrite with all his might, cracking it, but as the Alexandrite cracks so does Carmilla, her body breaks like the gem and shatters like a piece of glass, she smiles at Edgar closing her eyes thinking about all the things she couldn't tell him, falling apart and then disappear into nothingness. Carmilla leaves behind only her charm.
<br>Edgar is seen destroy Carmilla in satellite footage. Carmilla is marthyrized by the church while Edgar is demonized and accused with the highest degree of murder. News about this act spreads like wildfire. Edgar's body had adapted to Carmilla's demon toxins, and even though everyone in the network was healed, he is still the shadow vampire he's been this entire time. Unable to find a place to settle down in Huvia anymore, Edgar leaves for Vaxalif.
<br>Clay and Olivia join forces with Alice to investigate the blessed gemstones, Olivia gives Edgar a special phone to Edgar before he leaves, powered up by a self-replenishing battery invented by Alice.

$@"Edgar arrives in Vaxalif, following the trail of Carmilla's charm he is now wearing. Edgar traveled to the eastern side of the continent following the charm's link. After landing Edgar entered the mixed-race camp, ran by Aesthion Thyrris, Seraphs Church Archbishop of the Radiant Sun. Edgar is greeted kindly and warmly by Aesthion even though he looked scary. Aesthion explains Edgar about his fatherly connection with Carmilla through the charm, Aesthion upgrades his connection with Edgar so they may call each other at any given time instead of only sharing dreams.
<br>Edgar moves north looking for a place to live under the shadow and without being hunted as a demon by the church. Edgar finds humans and wolves north and starts to settle down, seeing the disparities and continuous fighting, Edgar forcefully takes control of both sides and forces them to unite, punishing those who refuse to cooperate with the other side. Edgar also meets the kids in these villages, notably Sigrid and Erling, who start to play with him seeing he does not actually want to hurt anyone. Sigrid moves first and the others follow her.
<br>Edgar and the others from Huvia start to exchange information in an attempt to find out what the gemstones are and what caused the death of Carmilla, Edgar is still traumatized by seeing her dying.
<br>As time goes by, Dainar from the church tracked down Edgar and head to the northern end of the Vaxalif continent. Dainar approached the village with the intent to kill Edgar, who is able to sense him approaching and prepare. The two start fighting while the civilians hide in their homes away from the fight and look from a distance. Dainar dodges Edgar's attacks in ways he had never seen before, counterattacking with his sword and his blessing of destruction, wishing Edgar's demonic soul to rest forever.
<br>The attack catches Edgar off guard, who is unable to defend himself and loses an arm and a big portion of his chest. Edgar, saying to Dainar that he will show him the demon he came to see, transforms intoa serpentine form, using Carmilla's remaining blood in him and powering up himself immensely, yet sacrificing his senses and fillign himself with rage and bloodlust. Edgar starts to attack Dainar, who seems to resist the first few hits but is then caught off guard by Edgarand has his helmet grabbed by Edgar, who tries to crush his skull but is unable to destroy the helmet, and forced to discard it.
<br>Dainar's face is revealed as an old and decrepit man who was fighting on par with him. Sigrid sees what is happening and sees Edgar isn't going to stop until Dainar is dead, so she jumps out of the house and runs to the battlefield, crying out for Edgar to stop this. Edgar hears her voice and slowly returns to his senses. Edgar lets Dainar run away and reverts to his form. Dainar runs to the Syndicate members, asking them for military aid in exterminating the north as the demon has been found by him there. Dusk Mereth and her elites army are called and join forces with Dainar.
<br>Edgar has decided to leave the north now that they seemed unified, and decided to head east, though Sigrid, Eliot and Eira refuse to let him go by himself and Sigrid reminds him he hadn't completed their training. Edgar leaves with the 3 kids following him. They travel together for some years, and Edgar notices how Sigrid seems to be an exceptionally skilled fighter, and Erling seems to be an exceptional strategist. Eira doesn't seem to excel but her healing abilities can help the group greatly. Erling started to also develop a crush on Erira as they traveled together.
<br>Meanwhile in Huvia, Alice and Kael are raising Lyria Corvalis and the dragon daughter, who have turned 5 years old.

$@"Dainar's order force Dusk and her men to try to assassinate Edgar. They try many times during the years, but Edgar proves to be resistant to most of their attempts, and invulnerable to the poison they tried to deply. Dusk avoids targetting any innocents like the children and spends more time to devise ways to target exclusively Edgar.
<br>Dainar's patience starts to run thin as the poison starts to kill him, he gives Dusk the order to kill him imediately, and gives her a time limit. Dusk starts to consider her options, seeing that Dainar would kill her for her failure if she didn't complete the mission, but she's more worried about her failure than her death. Dusk then decides to face Edgar herself in a last battle to eliminate him, as for her this is a do or die situation now.
<br>Dusk approaches Edgar when he's alone and assumes a fighting stance, without hiding and without cheap tricks. The two start to fight, and they seem evenly matched initially, but as the battle continues Dusk gets the upper hand and begins to deal increasing damage with her twinblade to him. Edgar is surprised by her sudden display of strength and takes a step back to transform, but having seen what he was doing from the previous battle with Dainar, she continues to push him back to prevent him from transforming.
<br>Edgar manages to strike her and create enough distance between them and giving him the time to transform into his serpentine form. Dusk dashed toward him and sees the snake attacks before he even launches them, gliding over them using her twinblade to avoid them and stabbing Edgar's chest with her attack, piercing his lungs. Edgar's power greatly diminishes in an instant, but with the blade still in hie chest he's able to grab Dusk and start throwing her around, knowcking her down and defeating her. Carmilla's toxins in his body almost run out due to this.
<br>Dainar sees Dusk's failure, he is weakened but so is Edgar in this moment. Dainar steps out of the shadows and confronts Edgar once again, while shadow elves from Dusk's squad take her away to be medicated. Dainar fights him in a weakened state due to the poison and manages to get many strikes in causing his body to slowly fall apart, Edgar is forced to use the last remaining bit of Carmilla's toxins and break Dainar's armor, but collapse himself as a result for the immense strain put on his body by Dainar's destruction. As Edgar opened his eyes he found his hands covered with blood, and Dainar's lifeless body on the ground.
<br>Sigrid sitting by Edgar with blood on her own hands and the knife she was holding. Edgar managed to get up and Eira helped him heal a little, but then Dainar's body started to disintegrate and all the matter forming his body flew up into a singular point and reassembled as a piece of Obsidian containing all of the power from the blessing of Destruction.
<br>After recovering, Edgar asks Aesthion about it, and received from him a confirmation that ancient texts reveal that a gem is formed by the body of a dying blessed marthyr. Dainar will be seen by the church as a marthyr regardless of what Edgar does now, but this helps him understand the blessed gemstones more.
<br>Edgar talks with Alice and Clay to share the information gathered about the Obsidian gem, Clay confirms his theory about the Alexandrite being created in the same way by the girl absorbed by the sanctuary over a century ago. It has been 6 years since Edgar had left Huvia, but he decides to head back for the moment and bring the kids with him.
<br>By the time Edgar returned, Lyria has turned 6 and Ryoko has turned 15.
