A battle start between them, in which it's clear that Audrey has the upper hand. The weavermaid ambushes Audrey while Edgar and Carmilla are fighting, but the tactic fails.
<br>Audrey is overwhelming them, Edgar is forced into a defensive stance as Audrey starts to repeatedly attack him with her many blood whips, striking him from every angle and starting to accumulate damage on him. Carmilla seized the opportunity to dash toward Audrey, she uses the rapier Edgar trained her with and rolls the whip attacks away from her, dodging them until she's close enough to Audrey to stab her chest. Carmilla hugs Audrey as both fall to the ground together.
<br>As they're falling, Carmilla bites into Audrey's neck, taking her blood and ascending to a vampire lord herself. The battle continues, now Audrey cannot use her network to regenerate either as Carmilla is a lord in her same network. Edgar feels something shift inside him after Carmilla's lord ascent.

Edgar drops Carmilla in the middle of the werewolves army and she starts dancing, vampirizing every one of them in gruesome ways using her blood constructs.
<br>Carmilla ends up facing the werewolf lord. Seraphiel intervenes giving the lord additional strength, making her halo appear behind him as he is blessed by her power. Carmilla's speed and strength get immediately outclassed by the lord, which starts to beat her down violently. Carmilla is unable to fight back, but her regeneration grants her pseudo-immortality. The werewolf lord starts to tire himself out giving Carmilla the opportunity to immobilize it in one single strike. Carmilla doesn't kill him, but vampirizes him so he may be healed afterwards.
<br>Carmilla and Edgar head north to confront the last demon lord standing. Edgar flies Carmilla to the Monolith, where the Lich lord is waiting for them. Like with the werewolf, the Lich is empowered by Seraphiel and a halo appears behind him. Carmilla had decided to fight him on her own, but as she sees the lich absorbing her energy and almost nullify her healing, she calls in for Edgar to help her.
<br>Edgar tried to absorb the energy from the Lich, but is unable to fully drain him as the energy within him is immense. Edgar can feel it's a combination of many different energies, and as he's absorbing them he has to release them as the same time, radiating his body with heat and starting to glow. With the Lich's energy being drained enough, Carmilla is able to deal a fatal blow and destroy it.
<br>With the grand majority of the demons converted into vampires in this continent, Carmilla rises to the top of the Monolith and extracts the Alexantrite from within, making the giant cross shaped structure collapse. Carmilla 's soul is linked with the gemstone by Seraphiel as she started to use it.
<br>The Alexandrite's power spreads through Carmilla's network, destroying every trace of the demon toxins and undoing the transformation on every one. Making Olivia, Clay, the Weaver, the Dryad and every other demon turn back into their mortal selves before the disaster.
<br>Carmilla attempts to destroy the Alexandrite, but with her power fading she's unable to do. Edgar strikes the Alexandrite with all his might, cracking it, but as the Alexandrite cracks so does Carmilla, her body breaks like the gem and shatters like a piece of glass, she smiles at Edgar closing her eyes thinking about all the things she couldn't tell him, falling apart and then disappear into nothingness. Carmilla leaves behind only her charm.
<br>Edgar is seen destroy Carmilla in satellite footage. Carmilla is marthyrized by the church while Edgar is demonized and accused with the highest degree of murder. News about this act spreads like wildfire. Edgar's body had adapted to Carmilla's demon toxins, and even though everyone in the network was healed, he is still the shadow vampire he's been this entire time. Unable to find a place to settle down in Huvia anymore, Edgar leaves for Vaxalif.

After landing Edgar entered the mixed-race camp, ran by Aesthion Thyrris, Seraphs Church Archbishop of the Radiant Sun. Edgar is greeted kindly and warmly by Aesthion even though he looked scary. Aesthion explains Edgar about his fatherly connection with Carmilla through the charm, Aesthion upgrades his connection with Edgar so they may call each other at any given time instead of only sharing dreams.
<br>Edgar moves north looking for a place to live under the shadow and without being hunted as a demon by the church. Edgar finds humans and wolves north and starts to settle down, seeing the disparities and continuous fighting, Edgar forcefully takes control of both sides and forces them to unite, punishing those who refuse to cooperate with the other side. Edgar also meets the kids in these villages, notably Sigrid and Erling, who start to play with him seeing he does not actually want to hurt anyone. Sigrid moves first and the others follow her.
<br>Edgar and the others from Huvia start to exchange information in an attempt to find out what the gemstones are and what caused the death of Carmilla, Edgar is still traumatized by seeing her dying.
<br>As time goes by, Dainar from the church tracked down Edgar and head to the northern end of the Vaxalif continent. Dainar approached the village with the intent to kill Edgar, who is able to sense him approaching and prepare. The two start fighting while the civilians hide in their homes away from the fight and look from a distance. Dainar dodges Edgar's attacks in ways he had never seen before, counterattacking with his sword and his blessing of destruction, wishing Edgar's demonic soul to rest forever.
<br>The attack catches Edgar off guard, who is unable to defend himself and loses an arm and a big portion of his chest. Edgar, saying to Dainar that he will show him the demon he came to see, transforms intoa serpentine form, using Carmilla's remaining blood in him and powering up himself immensely, yet sacrificing his senses and fillign himself with rage and bloodlust. Edgar starts to attack Dainar, who seems to resist the first few hits but is then caught off guard by Edgarand has his helmet grabbed by Edgar, who tries to crush his skull but is unable to destroy the helmet, and forced to discard it.
<br>Dainar's face is revealed as an old and decrepit man who was fighting on par with him. Sigrid sees what is happening and sees Edgar isn't going to stop until Dainar is dead, so she jumps out of the house and runs to the battlefield, crying out for Edgar to stop this. Edgar hears her voice and slowly returns to his senses. Edgar lets Dainar run away and reverts to his form. Dainar runs to the Syndicate members, asking them for military aid in exterminating the north as the demon has been found by him there. Dusk Mereth and her elites army are called and join forces with Dainar.
<br>Edgar has decided to leave the north now that they seemed unified, and decided to head east, though Sigrid, Eliot and Eira refuse to let him go by himself and Sigrid reminds him he hadn't completed their training. Edgar leaves with the 3 kids following him. They travel together for some years, and Edgar notices how Sigrid seems to be an exceptionally skilled fighter, and Erling seems to be an exceptional strategist. Eira doesn't seem to excel but her healing abilities can help the group greatly. Erling started to also develop a crush on Erira as they traveled together.

They try many times during the years, but Edgar proves to be resistant to most of their attempts, and invulnerable to the poison they tried to deply. Dusk avoids targetting any innocents like the children and spends more time to devise ways to target exclusively Edgar.
<br>Dainar's patience starts to run thin as the poison starts to kill him, he gives Dusk the order to kill him imediately, and gives her a time limit. Dusk starts to consider her options, seeing that Dainar would kill her for her failure if she didn't complete the mission, but she's more worried about her failure than her death. Dusk then decides to face Edgar herself in a last battle to eliminate him, as for her this is a do or die situation now.
<br>Dusk approaches Edgar when he's alone and assumes a fighting stance, without hiding and without cheap tricks. The two start to fight, and they seem evenly matched initially, but as the battle continues Dusk gets the upper hand and begins to deal increasing damage with her twinblade to him. Edgar is surprised by her sudden display of strength and takes a step back to transform, but having seen what he was doing from the previous battle with Dainar, she continues to push him back to prevent him from transforming.
<br>Edgar manages to strike her and create enough distance between them and giving him the time to transform into his serpentine form. Dusk dashed toward him and sees the snake attacks before he even launches them, gliding over them using her twinblade to avoid them and stabbing Edgar's chest with her attack, piercing his lungs. Edgar's power greatly diminishes in an instant, but with the blade still in hie chest he's able to grab Dusk and start throwing her around, knowcking her down and defeating her. Carmilla's toxins in his body almost run out due to this.
<br>Dainar sees Dusk's failure, he is weakened but so is Edgar in this moment. Dainar steps out of the shadows and confronts Edgar once again, while shadow elves from Dusk's squad take her away to be medicated. Dainar fights him in a weakened state due to the poison and manages to get many strikes in causing his body to slowly fall apart, Edgar is forced to use the last remaining bit of Carmilla's toxins and break Dainar's armor, but collapse himself as a result for the immense strain put on his body by Dainar's destruction. As Edgar opened his eyes he found his hands covered with blood, and Dainar's lifeless body on the ground.

<br>After recovering, Edgar asks Aesthion about it, and received from him a confirmation that ancient texts reveal that a gem is formed by the body of a dying blessed marthyr. Dainar will be seen by the church as a marthyr regardless of what Edgar does now, but this helps him understand the blessed gemstones more.

At the great door Dawn Star is waiting for her, now that she remembers everything Lyria attacks her moments after seeing her, using her newfound draconic strength and causing an explosion so powerful it makes the entire sanctuary's structure crumble down on them.
<br>Satisfied with her alchemical experimentiation, Dawn Star leaves for the north, intending to use the land and people to continue creating more chimeras. Lyria emerges from the rubble unscathed and meets again with Alice, who is horrified to learn what had happened to her daughters. Alice has to deliver the unfortunate news to Kael and Edgar. Dawn Star' image is caught by some cameras as she's dashing north and the next morning Archbishop Carillon is holding a speech to warn the residents north of Dawn Star, accusing Edgar once again of having corrupted an innocent soul with sin and stating the church's army is heading north.
<br>Kael is enraged and broken by the news, he intends to head north to take care of the one who did this to his child, but is stopped by Edgar who asks him who'd take care of his family if he died. Kael enraged punches Edgar, but this hit hurts Kael more as he sees what this is making him do. Edgar tells Kael he already intends to head north with Dusk, and tells Kael he could come with them if he knocked Edgar down. Edgar and Kael start to fight, Kael is knocked down by Edgar almost immediately, but he gets up just as fast.
<br>Edgar knocks down Kael multiple times, while Kael's own hits do minimal damage to Edgar, as the battle got more desperate Kael's wolf-like instincts start to activate and his rust starts coming off, so Kael gets a good hit on Edgar, from this point on Kael's strength continues to gradually increase with his abilities reactivating, Kael can't fully knock out Edgar though as he's able to defend himself too well, but manages to get Edgar on his knee with a series of attacks. Edgar accepts Kael to come with them. Alice and Edgar both saw that Lyria was transmutated using alchemy and Alice demands to come with him, Edgar is unable to refuse.
<br>A team with Edgar, Dusk, Alice and Kael is created and the four of of them begin heading north, as they're flying under them they noticed the church's army moving north inside various vehicles. Seraphiel, tired of Edgar's inability to follow her tips decides to pose as Borealis and answer to Carillon's prayers, starting to guide him to find the diamond infused with her blessing. In the north, Dawn Star starts to create new variations of chimeras.

$@"Edgar flies to the north with the group they had formed, taking breaks for the nights an continuing heading north for 2 days. During this time, Leila had decided to visit Kael's mansion to see Alice, but once there she is greeded by Erling and learns what happened to Lyria and her sister, and why Kael and Alice had moved to the north. Leila spends some time with Lyria until 2 days later she opened her eyes, shaking and looking around to find her parents she neened, only to see Leila and the siblings. Lyria takes some deep breaths to try to calm down and asks them where Kael and Alice were. Leila tells her what happened, Lyria immediately gets out of her bed and jumps out of the window.
<br>Lyria's wings spread as she starts to fly, but Leila had also made up her mind and she wasn't going to sit behind on this, forming a lazo Leila catcher Lyria's tail midair and starts to fly with her. Lyria feels the pull but continues moving forward and higher in the air, accelerating gradually until she and Leila looked only like a blur. In only a few hours Lyria covers the distance Edgar covered in 2 days, and as Lyria saw the group down on the ground after that fast trip, she starts to decelerate but not knowing how to properly land she crash lands with Leila on the ground near Edgar. Edgar is mad at both of them for having come, but Lyria ignores him and goes to scold her parents.
<br>Stone golemns created as chimeras by Dawn Star emerge from the ground, the leave sad sounds and express the wish to be killed by them, but are forced by Dawn Star to fight. The group feels pity to these poor souls and accepts killing them is giving them mercy. They keep moving north until they have an encounter with Dawn Star. Alice confronts Dawn Star, who shows using alchemy in response. Dawn Star starts revealing everything she's done and how she's used Alice and Lyria as experiment rats.
<br>Dawn Star creates a new chimera right in front of Alice, creating a new body and infusing it with a copy of Lyria's soul, following up with the 5 etherian elements that Dawn Star can synthetize with mana. Lyria's copy's body cracks under the alchemical elemenst clashing with each other, tearing her body apart from the inside, Lyria's copy looks at Alice and begs her to kill her, calling her mom. Alice breaks as she can't take this anymore. Edgar and Lyria feel the etherian elements surge inside Alice and both know what is about to happen.
<br>Lyria attemps to rush toward Alice to stop her from using collapse on such a large scale, but Edgar grabs her and shoves her back, telling everyone to get away and for Dusk to teleport away. Lyria tried to save Alice, but Edgar didn't let her, instead making her get dragged away by Dusk. Seeing this incredible reaction, Dawn Star has no choice but to retreat and get away from Alice, escaping. Ensuring everyone else got away, Edgar jumps in and stops Alice from causing such a large scale destructive attack. Both of them stop for a moment and let the moment sink in.
<br>Dusk returns with everyone seeing that Edgar stopped Alice. Edgar slaps Alice and tells her if she can't control her emotions she should go back to Amanthir, and that he can't watch her kill herself due to an outburst like this. Alice realizing Edgar is right and that she did break the oath she took a long time ago, starts to cry. Lyria jumps in and hugs Alice, crying and calling her an idiot for making her worry like that, followed by Kael, the family shares a moment together. Lyria confronts Edgar for pushing her back, calling him an hypocrite and hating him for stopping her from saving Alice. Edgar doesn't counter her and lets her hate him.

$@"Alice needs to rest, so the group sets up camp for the afternoon, planning to rest util the next day. Lyria keeps her distance from Edgar, wanting to spend more time with her parents as she was now terrified of losing them. Having seen Dawn Star, Lyria understands why Alice decided to go north so suddenly, as another alchemy user is a danger to the entire continent. Leila doesn't like to see that rift, but can't intervene as Dusk tells Leila this is a personal matter an she shouldn't interfere, which Leila agrees with.
<br>The next morning, the church's army is approaching their camp. Edgar was up early and on guard, he sees them approach and rushed in his tent to wake up Dusk, wanting to have her teleport the group away from here, absolutely not wanting them to see the faces of the people helping Edgar, but before Dusk can do anything Carillon appears behind her and seals her. He, now wearing white long robes and glowing in a divine yellow light, starts giving a long speech on Edgar's corruption and sins, and the reasons he is going to get executed today.
<br>With Dusk sealed, Edgar is the one left to fight. He looks at the army, as they looked extremely organized and prepared and then Carillon hovering in the air the opposite way, circling him and not allowing him any easy escape. Edgar decides to bet everything and activates his dark powers to their fullest extent and starts to fight the army. His bet pays off and he's able to attract Aurielia's gaze and receive his blessing, but Seraphiel does not agree with this, Seraphiel rewinds back time just a moment to buff Edgar with her light, canceling out his darkness with her light for a moment. Having received Aurielia's gaze, but temporarily tied with Dusk, they're both called upon by her.
<br>Neither Edgar or Dusk remember her as they're both awake this time, but they both feel like they've seen her before. Aurielia explains she wanted to bless Edgar, but now refuses to due to his light, she blesses Dusk with her power and grabs her chin, explaining her that she likes her ideas. Back to the battleground, no time has passed since Aurielia's call and blessing, Edgar's dark abilities permanently disappear as a result of Seraphiel's light, all the toxins in his body disappear and he's unable to make more. Edgar is being surrounded by the shields and spears of the army, he makes a spear himself to push them back and when they try to circle him, he plants it into the ground and makes is explode like a flashbang, stunning the ones around him.
<br>Edgar breaks through their lines and jumps to the backlines, knocking down the last line of shields and then the mages. With his rust disappearing Edgar starts to clean up the men in the army. He is pierced by swords and daggers by the enemies but keeps going, Dusk sees Edgar getting wounded and inside her grows anger against the army and the chuch. She undoes Carillon's seal with the power of her own blessing of dark and moves out to face him. Before fighting him, she makes clouds of darkness from her body, which each go into every tent and absorb each person, turning into shadows that moved away from the battle as to prevent them from being seen.
<br>Dusk tries to attack Carillon, but is unable to find an opening on him, Carillon is flying up high so she can't reach him, his body is emitting light, so he has no shadows she can use and for any attack from afar Carillion is able to create a shield to defend himself with it. Lyria, who was being dragged away as a shadow, takes control of the darkness around her using her own ability and reforms in her body, surrounding herself with a dark aura, and shooting herself in the air the same direction she was coming from. Lyria comes flying at mach speed toward Carillon who sees her coming and is forced to block her with his light, the clash of light and dark causes the darkness around Lyria to disperse.
<br>Dusk seizes the opportunity and teleports in one of the clouds of darkness floating around, forming her trusty dark twinblade and cleaving his hand with the gem off. Carillon can't sustain the light attack anymore and can't stop Lyria anymore, she double axes him into the ground, causing him to crash and severily injure himself further and his blood to splatter. Dusk lands and goes to recover the diamond, but as she tried to touch it it fizzled and caused her pain in response to her darkness. Lyria needs help from Dusk to get on the ground and she isn't able to pick up the diamond either. Carillon in the meantime used his ice to close his wounds and replaced his missing hand with an ice construct. Dusk and Lyria team up and finish off Carillon.
<br>Edgar wiped out the army, his body is torn apart by all the damage taken in this battle, his regeneration is weakened and unable to keep up the healing. His vision grew blurry, but he started seeing a light, his vision grew dark but he kept following the light, until he collapsed on the ground, but his hand ended up on the gem, transferring his conciousness to Seraphiel's domain.
