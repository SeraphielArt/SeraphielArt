# SeraphielArt
## Purpose
SeraphielArt is a side project started by me, as a favor to some friends that helped me get through a thought part of my life. I owe them a lot and this isn't nearly enough to repay them, it did start as a side project for fun and slowly grew into a platform I can use to store my stories and my friends as a calculator for their own services.

It's both a help to people I care about and a help for myself as I experiment with new technologies and learn as I keep writing the code behind it.

## How does it work?
SeraphielArt is a webapp written using .NET 8 Razor pages, which combine C# with the HTML stack.

Since I didn't want to spend much time on developing an UI (I'm not too great at developing an UI with my own ideas) I have used a [template](https://bootstrapmade.com/nice-admin-bootstrap-admin-html-template/)

The webapp itself is hosted on an Azure server paid out of my own pocket, to reduce costs I have decided not to have a database connected to it which limits the kind of content this page can host.

## Will this be maintained in the future?
For now I don't plan on stopping updating the page. I have ideas to keep adding and will keep working on them.
